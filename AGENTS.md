# AGENTS.md — Halo

Halo — a nightshade neon Electron shell that lets herdr run trails locally,
with your repos and agents in one live view. Two-week spike (Nov 2026),
Linear XVOIDSX-71, exploratory. This file is the repo's working notes:
what to build, where things live, and the lessons that apply here.

## What Halo is

- An Electron **app on top of a harness**, not a harness. The harness is
  replaceable; the app is the product.
- Local-first with Ollama, BYOK for other providers. Keys live only in
  `~/.config/halo/settings.json` (0600) — never in the repo, never logged,
  never sent to xvoidsx.
- Halo is a **herdr client, not a replacement**. It asks herdr to do the
  work and renders what comes back.
- **No telemetry anywhere.** No usage events, no error reports, no phone-home.
- Navi-first; Windows/Mac later. Keep it lean — it has to feel fine on a
  T440p (3.5 GB usable) and a Cloudbook, not just a fast desktop.

## Layout

- `electron/` — main process: `main.ts` (window + IPC), `preload.ts`
  (typed contextBridge — the renderer never touches Node directly),
  `herdrAdapter.ts` (herdr CLI boundary), `settingsFile.ts`
  (`~/.config/halo/settings.json`).
- `src/` — renderer (React + Vite): `App.tsx` (sidebar trails, main trail
  view, settings), `theme.css` (nightshadeNeon), `types.ts` (shared types),
  `mockTrails.ts` (MOCK data — delete the moment real trail data flows).
- `electron-builder.yml` — Linux `.deb` packaging. Output goes to `release/`
  (not `dist/`, which is Vite's renderer output).

## Herdr rules (from navi's own herdr work)

- Address agents by **`pane_id`**, never by bare label. The `agent` field in
  `herdr agent list` is a display label, not a target — `attach`/`read`
  do not resolve bare labels.
- Never fabricate an agent status you did not observe. A stub that says
  "not implemented" is correct; a fake "live" connection is not.
- `herdr agent list` output shape is best-effort parsed (JSON first, then
  raw lines). Verify the real format on a machine with herdr installed
  before trusting the agent list.

## Electron / packaging lessons (xvoidsx)

- **Never set `GH_TOKEN` on the electron-builder build step** — it makes
  electron-builder attempt a GitHub publish and fail the build. Releases
  are cut separately (softprops/action-gh-release with `GITHUB_TOKEN`).
- Pin `electron-builder` (currently 26.18.0) — do not float it.
- **`.deb` must be gzip-compressed.** `dpkg-deb` here defaults to zstd,
  which older dpkg fails on ("Unknown frame descriptor"). Verify with
  `dpkg-deb --info` / `file` that the built deb uses gzip before shipping,
  and verify asar contents (`npx asar list`) + deb permissions
  (`dpkg-deb -c`).
- Always commit `package-lock.json` — `npm ci` on CI fails without it.

## Verification before claiming anything

- `npm run typecheck`, then `npm run build`. Both must pass.
- Never claim a window launch you did not verify. If the sandbox has no
  display, say so and record what was actually run.
- Bench on Cloudbook / T440p before calling the spike done.

## Copy

User-facing strings name the actor and point at the next step ("herdr is
not installed (not on PATH)" beats "something went wrong"). No dead ends,
no bare error codes in the UI.
